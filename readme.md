# Employer Service

This code represents a service class in the `com.example.employer.service` package that interacts with a MongoDB database and includes the ELK (Elasticsearch,
Logstash, Kibana) stack for visualizing logs in Kibana. The service provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an `Employer` entity.

## Dependencies

This code relies on the following dependencies:

- `com.example.employer.dto.EmployerDTO`: This class represents the data transfer object for an employer.
- `com.example.employer.exceptions.EmployerNotFoundException`: This exception is thrown when an employer is not found.
- `com.example.employer.model.Employer`: This class represents the employer entity.
- `com.example.employer.repository.EmployerRepository`: This repository provides methods for interacting with the MongoDB database.
- `com.example.employer.service.imp.EmployerMapper`: This mapper class maps between `EmployerDTO` and `Employer` objects.
- `org.springframework.stereotype.Service`: This annotation identifies the class as a service component in the Spring framework.
- `lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor`: This annotation generates a constructor with required arguments.
- `lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j`: This annotation enables logging using the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J).

## Service Methods

### findAllEmployers

```java
public List<EmployerDTO> findAllEmployers()
```

This method retrieves all employers from the MongoDB database, maps them to `EmployerDTO` objects using the `EmployerMapper`, and returns a list
of `EmployerDTO` objects.

### getEmployerByID

```java
public EmployerDTO getEmployerByID(String id)
```

This method retrieves an employer from the MongoDB database based on the given ID. It maps the found employer to an `EmployerDTO` object using
the `EmployerMapper` and returns the `EmployerDTO`. If no employer is found, it throws an `EmployerNotFoundException`.

### saveEmployee

```java
public void saveEmployee(EmployerDTO employerDTO)
```

This method saves a new employer to the MongoDB database. If the employer already has an ID, it uses that ID; otherwise, it generates a new UUID as the ID. The
method maps the `EmployerDTO` to an `Employer` object using the `EmployerMapper`, sets the ID, and saves it to the database. It logs the action with the saved
employer's ID.

### deleteEmployerByID

```java
public void deleteEmployerByID(String id)
```

This method deletes an employer from the MongoDB database based on the given ID. It removes the employer with the specified ID from the database. It logs the
action with the deleted employer's ID.

### updateEmployer

```java
public void updateEmployer(String id,EmployerDTO updatedEmployer)
```

This method updates an existing employer in the MongoDB database. It retrieves the employer based on the given ID, throws an `EmployerNotFoundException` if not
found, maps the `updatedEmployer` to the existing employer using the `EmployerMapper`, sets the ID, and saves it to the database. It logs the action with the
updated employer's ID.

## Logging

This code utilizes logging for various actions using SLF4J. The logging statements include the log level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`) and relevant
information about the performed action, such as the number of employers found, the ID of an employer, or a warning message.

## ELK Stack Integration

This code is integrated with the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for visualizing logs in Kibana. The ELK stack provides a centralized logging
solution where logs can be collected, processed, and analyzed. The logs generated by this code are sent to Logstash, which parses and forwards them to
Elasticsearch for indexing. Finally, Kibana is used to search, analyze, and visualize the logs stored in Elasticsearch.
